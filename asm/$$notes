   If the current record length is zero, go to the end-of-data routine,
 if present, otherwise abort the caller.

   Return the current record.  Add the current record length to the
   current record address to obtain the new record address,

Point
   If the low byte of the address field is zero, use the supplied record
   address. If it's nonzero, advance to the next record.

Bldl
   Return the starting address of each of the the specified "members".

Find
   Return the starting address of the specified "member". Point the
   file to its start.

Write
   Store the supplied record in the current storage location. If at
   the end of the file, create a new EOF marker.

Stow: Add, Replace
   Add the supplied member name in the member table, together with
   its start address.

   Set current file pointer to location past the end of the file,
   create a new EOF marker.

   Take a note of the address.
