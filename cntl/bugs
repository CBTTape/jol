The command "ALLOC FILE(SYSPRINT) DA(*)" fails with invalid dataset name

the file $$jol.inst sometimes gets deleted but not unallocated. this
causes a 213 abend. re-running from the beginning overcomes the problem.

I tried GET FRED which filled all my symbol table with cards. The member
was too large.

The monitor tests for and opens JOBLIB (not JOBLIB$). This will already
have been done by OS, and is pretty meaningless.

The compiler generates a joblib even when dynamic is specified.  This is
  now fixed: the joblib is suppressed. The scheduler allocates JOBLIB$,
  so now the monitor should use STEPLIB (if present)  and then JOBLIB
  (again, if present). I will NOT use both.

We must find a way to make ujd03ds1 work for both the compiler and the
scheduler.
